CRITICAL
========

- Improve FAQ, docs (ongoing..)
- Integrated test suite (I'm so lazy..)

NOT SO CRITICAL
===============

- OpenSSL support.
- Fix for systems with no IPv6 (e.g. Solaris 7).
- PASV auto address guessing?
- option to chroot to home dir and THEN apply init_dir
- pasv_addr_file option (patch from Adam Luter)
- Sweedish characters showing as ? in the log.
- Handle SIGINT.
- More stuff in the STAT output (session stats, etc. Perhaps even an "admin"
mode which dumps session details?).

- separate upload/download max rates
- select() is assuming Linux behaviour (not threatening stability)
- some FTP clients are trying to use MDTM to _set_ timestamps?
- add example global bandwidth limiting.
- put anon FTP users in wtmp too?
- switch to new signal model

ON THE BACK BURNER
==================

- lock the files being modified?
- Small race: signal might come in just before we start a blocking call
- log logout (pam session support provides this for locals)
- Limits on GIDs allowed to authenticate?

NOT PLANNED
===========

- telnet strings (no demand)
- "Minimal" build support
- transparent tar / compression support (no demand)
