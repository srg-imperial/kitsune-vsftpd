CRITICAL
========

NOT SO CRITICAL
===============

- separate upload/download max rates
- select() is assuming Linux behaviour (not threatening stability)
- IPv6 support
- enhance standalone support (IP filtering, concurrent connection limits)

ON THE BACK BURNER
==================

- pam_session - I don't think it buys me wtmp
- transfer stats
- Small race: signal might come in just before we start a blocking call
- wtmp support (should be done through pam_session support?)
- OpenSSL support

NOT PLANNED
===========

- syslog() support - I don't want to encourage the broken beast
- telnet strings (no demand)
- better pattern matching in "ls" (no demand)
- "Minimal" build support
- transparent tar / compression support (no demand)
