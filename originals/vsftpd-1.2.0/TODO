CRITICAL
========

- Improve FAQ, docs.
- Integrated test suite (I'm so lazy..)

NOT SO CRITICAL
===============

- PASV auto address guessing?
- option to chroot to home dir and THEN apply init_dir
- pasv_addr_file option (patch from Adam Luter)
- Sweedish characters showing as ? in the log.
- Limits on GIDs allowed to authenticate?

- separate upload/download max rates
- select() is assuming Linux behaviour (not threatening stability)
- some FTP clients are trying to use MDTM to _set_ timestamps?
- add example global bandwidth limiting.
- put anon FTP users in wtmp too?
- switch to new signal model

ON THE BACK BURNER
==================

- lock the files being modified?
- repeated PORT problem?
- transfer stats
- Small race: signal might come in just before we start a blocking call
- OpenSSL support
- log logout (pam session support provides this for locals)

NOT PLANNED
===========

- telnet strings (no demand)
- better pattern matching in "ls" (no demand)
- "Minimal" build support
- transparent tar / compression support (no demand)
