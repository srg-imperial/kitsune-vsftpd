This file contains information on the audit status of the code in this program.
Each file has an audit code of between 1 and 5, ranging from 1 being unaudited
and 5 being heavily audited by multiple competent people.

The important rule is that when a file is changed, the audit status goes back
to 1, _unless_ the change(s) are audited very carefully as they go in.
