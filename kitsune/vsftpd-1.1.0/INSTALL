For now, just type "make" and mail me if it doesn't build.
Running "make install" will try to copy the binary, man pages, etc. to
somewhere sensible.

Once built, you will need to run the binary from an inetd of some kind.

The FTP server will refuse to start up unless you satisfy a few prerequisites:
1) You will need the user "ftp" to exist and have a valid home directory. The
home directory must NOT be owned by the "ftp" user, nor must it be writable
by the FTP user.
2) You will need the user "nobody" to exist.
3) You will need an empty directory /usr/share/empty to exist.

Note that "ftp" "nobody" and "/usr/share/empty" are not hard-coded; you may
specify values for these in the config file.

If you are running vsftpd on a PAM enabled machine, you will need to have a
/etc/pam.d/ftp file present, otherwise non-anonymous logins will fail. [NOTE -
if you have an older version of PAM, that file might be /etc/pam.conf]

As well as the above three pre-requisites, you are recommended to install a
config file. The default location for the config file is /etc/vsftpd.conf.
There is a sample vsftpd.conf in the distribution tarball. You probably want
to copy that to /etc/vsftpd.conf as a basis for modification. For example,
the default configuration allows neither local user logins nor anonymous
uploads. You may wish to change these defaults.

If you have virtual hosting running, you may find it useful to specify the
config file on the command line. This is accomplished by specifying a single
command line argument which is a pathname to the config file. If using inetd
as opposed to xinetd, be careful to specify the program name argv[0] before
the config file location argv[1]!
