CRITICAL
========

- Improve FAQ, docs (ongoing..)
- Integrated test suite (I'm so lazy..)

NOT SO CRITICAL
===============

- Fix SIGHUP config file reload to correctly reset _removed_ settings to
their default values.
- Allow listener to listen on multiple IPs; bonus points if the different
IPs can have different configs.
- Upload file size limits.
- Allow groups to be listed in user lists.
- Allow space in username.
- Minor: background should happen after listen has completed so that failure
can result in a non-zero exit code.
- Better reporting of failed uploads due to out of device space or quota all
used.
- option to chroot to home dir and THEN apply init_dir
- pasv_addr_file option (patch from Adam Luter)
- Sweedish characters showing as ? in the log.

- separate upload/download max rates
- select() is assuming Linux behaviour (not threatening stability)
- add example global bandwidth limiting.
- put anon FTP users in wtmp too?
- switch to new signal model

ON THE BACK BURNER
==================

- MLST, MLSD
- LPRT, LPSV
- lock the files being modified?
- Small race: signal might come in just before we start a blocking call
- log logout (pam session support provides this for locals)
- Limits on GIDs allowed to authenticate?
- Dynamic login info e.g. you are user XXX of YYY.
- Handle SIGINT.
- Session byte transfer counts in STAT output.
- OOPS: capset issue with some 2.6 kernel / distro combinations (cannot
reproduce; kernel bug?)
- Mac OS X setgroups() issue (report of success with 10.3.4, maybe OS X bug
has been fixed?)
- Fix for systems with no IPv6 (e.g. Solaris 7) (I'm only getting limited
numbers of these reports)

NOT PLANNED
===========

- telnet strings (no demand)
- "Minimal" build support
- transparent tar / compression support (no demand)
